Frankenkorg RK-100 brain replacement

This Arduino sketch implements a new brain for a Korg RK-100 MIDI keytar.
See http://www.cassettepunk.com for information on the project, including the circuit.

STATUS:
Reliable and usable.

TODO:
- Improve behavior of state changes (e.g. octave shifts, program changes) when keys are pressed. Currently they will remain pressed.
